## Tools

- [**`pdz.py`**](https://github.com/jaames/playdate-reverse-engineering/blob/main/tools/pdz.py) - Unpacks all files from a `.pdz` file container
- [**`pdex2elf.py`**](https://github.com/jaames/playdate-reverse-engineering/blob/main/tools/pdex2elf.py) - Converts a `pdex.bin` to an ELF file that can be analysed in a decompilation tool such as Ghidra
- [**`usbeval.py`**](https://github.com/jaames/playdate-reverse-engineering/blob/main/tools/usbeval.py) - Uses the Playdate's (unused?) USB `eval` command to evaluate a Lua script over USB. Has access to the Lua runtime of the currently loaded game, except for system apps...

## Special Thanks

 - [Simon](https://github.com/simontime) for helping with some ADPCM audio reverse engineering
 - [Zhuowei](https://github.com/zhuowei) for this [script for unpacking Playdate .pdx executables](https://gist.github.com/zhuowei/666c7e6d21d842dbb8b723e96164d9c3), which was the base for `pdz.py`
 - The folks at [Panic](https://panic.com/) for making such a wonderful and fascinating handheld!
